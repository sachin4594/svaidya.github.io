## Teaching
I served as a graduate teaching assistant for the following courses:

- Wave Motion and Quantum Mechanics, Penn State, Fall 2018
- Fluids and Thermal Physics, Penn State, Fall 2018
- Mechanics and Intro Physics Laboratory, Penn State, Summer 2018
- Mechanics, Penn State, Spring 2018
- Introductory Physics, Penn State, Fall 2017

In the spring of 2018, I was awarded the [Graduate Teaching Assistant Award](https://science.psu.edu/physics/graduate/awards/student-teaching) by the Department of Physics at Penn State for 'teaching excellence in physics,' based on feedback from hundreds of students. You can read some of the student feedback [here](https://sachin4594.github.io/svaidya.github.io/files/Selected_Student_Comments.pdf).

## Mentorship
I have mentored several undergraduate students and guided their research projects over the past four years:

- Yichen (Sophie) Li, MIT, UROP, Fall 2024-present
- Amelie A. Chan, MIT, UROP, Fall 2024-present 
- Taohan Lin, MIT, UROP, Fall 2024-present
- Eric Wang, MIT, UROP, Fall 2024-present
- Luke Huang, MIT, UROP, Fall 2024-present
- Oriol Mayne i Comas, MIT, Erasmus Intern, Fall 2024-present
- Raafat Salib, MIT, UROP, Spring 2024-present
- Shrish Choudhary, MIT, UROP, Spring 2024-present
- Manxi (Maggie) Shi, MIT, UROP, Fall 2023-present (Project: Confinement of light in three dimensions without photonic bandgaps -- _in preparation_)
- Kyle Linn, Penn State, REU, Summer 2022 ([Project: Reentrant delocalization transition in photonic quasicrystals](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.033170))
- Megan Goh, Amherst College, REU, Summer 2022 (Project: Hofstadter butterfly and topological states in photonic crystals -- _in preparation_)
- Alison Weiss, Amherst College, REU, Summer 2020 and 2021 ([Project: Searching for Fermi-arcs in woodpile photonic crystals](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/CUWIP22/Session/A01.47))

## Service
I frequently serve as a referee for the following physics and photonics journals:

- APS: Physical Review Letters, Physical Review X, Physical Review A, Physical Review B, Physical Review Applied, Physical Review Research
- Nature Publishing Group: Nature Physics, Nature Communications, Communications Physics
- AAAS: Science Advances
- Optica: Optica, Photonics Research, Optics Express
- Wiley: Advanced Optical Materials, Laser & Photonics Reviews
- AIP: APL Photonics, Applied Physics Letters, Journal of Applied Physics
- Oxford: National Science Review
- ACM: ACM Computing Surveys

I also serve as an external reviewer for user proposals submitted to the [Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT)](https://tours.sandia.gov/cint_info.html) at Sandia National Laboratories.
