I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://physics.mit.edu/) with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://marin-rle.mit.edu/). I received a PhD in Physics from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/physics) in 2023, where I was a part of [Prof. Mikael C. Rechtsman's](https://leptos.psu.edu/) research group. 

My research is both theoretical and experimental in nature and focuses broadly on photonic realizations of topological phases of matter, such as Weyl semi-metals and higher-order topological insulators. I am also interested in all things nanophotonics, topological matter, and artifical intelligence (AI) for physics. Read more about my research [here](research/).
