Hello! I'm Sachin Vaidya, a postdoctoral associate at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://physics.mit.edu/), working with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://marin-rle.mit.edu/). I am also a junior investigator at the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)](https://iaifi.org/). I earned my PhD in Physics from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/physics) in 2023, where I was part of [Prof. Mikael C. Rechtsman's](https://leptos.psu.edu/) research group. 

My research spans a wide array of topics, from nanophotonics and topological matter to the development of interpretable AI platforms for science and robotics. I enjoy collaborating with scientists from diverse fields, bringing together computational, theoretical, and experimental approaches to tackle complex and challenging problems. Read more about my research [here](research/).
