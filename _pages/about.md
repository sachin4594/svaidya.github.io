Hello! I'm Sachin Vaidya, a postdoctoral associate at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://physics.mit.edu/), working with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://marin-rle.mit.edu/). I am also a junior investigator at the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)](https://iaifi.org/). I earned my PhD in Physics from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/physics) in 2023, where I was part of [Prof. Mikael C. Rechtsman's](https://leptos.psu.edu/) research group. 

My research spans a wide array of topics, from nanophotonics and topological matter to interpretable AI for science, and has more recently expanded to include robotics (see below). I enjoy collaborating with scientists from diverse fields and backgrounds, bringing together theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to tackle complex problems in  physics and engineering. You can read more about my research [here](/research/) and find an up-to-date list of my publications [here](/publications/).
