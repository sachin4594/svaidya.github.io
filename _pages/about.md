Hello! I'm Sachin Vaidya, a postdoctoral associate at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://physics.mit.edu/), working with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://marin-rle.mit.edu/). I am also a junior investigator at the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)](https://iaifi.org/). I earned my PhD in Physics from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/physics) in 2023, where I was part of [Prof. Mikael C. Rechtsman's](https://leptos.psu.edu/) research group. 

My research spans a wide array of topics, from topological quantum matter and nanophotonics to interpretable AI for science, and robotics. I enjoy collaborating with scientists from diverse fields, bringing together theoretical, computational, and experimental approaches to tackle complex problems in  physics and engineering. You can read more about my research [here](/research/) and find an up-to-date list of my publications [here](/publications/).

My CV can be found [here](https://sachin4594.github.io/svaidya.github.io/files/SV_CV_Nov_2025.pdf).
