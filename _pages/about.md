Hello! I'm Sachin Vaidya, a postdoctoral associate at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://physics.mit.edu/), working with [Prof. Marin Soljačić](https://marin-rle.mit.edu/). I am also a junior investigator at the [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)](https://iaifi.org/). I earned my PhD in Physics from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/physics) in 2023, where I was part of [Prof. Mikael C. Rechtsman's](https://leptos.psu.edu/) research group. 

My research spans a wide array of topics, from nanophotonics and topological matter to interpretable AI for science, and robotics. I enjoy collaborating with scientists from diverse fields, bringing together computational, theoretical, and experimental approaches to tackle complex problems in  physics and engineering. You can find my latest publications below and read more about my research [here](/research/).
