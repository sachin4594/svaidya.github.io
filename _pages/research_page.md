Topological insulators and semimetals are fascinating classes of materials that have recently emerged as a prominent subject of study in condensed matter physics. They represent new phases of matter that possess unique properties at their surfaces, hinges, edges or corners, distinct from those in the bulk. This results ultimately from the underlying non-trivial topology of the electronic band structure rather than any specific material property. Moreover, when quasiparticle interactions are strong, topological phases of matter can give rise to even more exotic phenomena, such as fractionalization and topological order. In the last decade, many ideas from topological matter have been extended to other systems that host wave-like excitations, such as light propagating in photonic crystals, where they serve as new guiding principles for photonic design.

These are some key questions that inform my research:
- How can we extend the principles of topological phases to photonic systems and leverage them for robust control over light?
- How can we systematically classify different topological phases of matter and their photonic analogs?

## Nanophotonics

The field of nanophotonics focuses on the manipulation and control of light on the nanometer scale. The unique properties of light-matter interactions at these scales arise from the confinement of photons to dimensions comparable to the wavelength of light. This confinement leads to phenomena such as enhanced optical forces, strong light-matter coupling, and the ability to manipulate light in ways that are impossible with traditional optical components. This precise control of light makes it possible to leverage effects like the Purcell effect to increase spontaneous emission rates or achieve supercollimation, promising advancements in applications such as developing nanophotonic scintillators to improve medical imaging.

Some key questions that inform my research:
- Can we find novel strategies for trapping and guiding light at the nanoscale to achieve strong light-matter coupling?
- What new functionalities can be achieved by combining nanophotonics with scintillation?

## Classical and quantum nonlinear optics
Over the past few decades, efforts have been directed at understanding and controlling nonlinear optical systems with many degrees of freedom (e.g., frequency/time, space/wavevector, polarization) due to their enhanced capacities to carry power, transmit data, and perform physical computations. However, to fully exploit these degrees of freedom, new guiding principles must be developed for the control and routing of excitations, as well as for managing noise within these complex systems, as such principles are currently lacking.

Some key questions that inform my research:
- What new physical phenomena emerge from the interplay of topology, symmetry and interactions in nonlinear optical systems?
- How can we robustly control noise in quantum systems and generate non-classical states of light?

Current AI models, while capable of achieving high accuracies in various tasks, are fundamentally limited in terms of interpretability. In contrast, advancements in physics often rely on key insights derived from experimental observations or numerical simulations. Consequently, developing novel AI frameworks that align closely with scientific goals is crucial for leveraing AI's capabilities for fundamental discoveries. Furthermore, as developments in AI continue to advance rapidly, there is a growing need to integrate robotic solutions with AI for accelerating experimental science through automation and intelligent decision-making.

Some key questions that inform my research:
- How do we develop interpretable AI models that are closely aligned with scientific goals?
- What does a future that employs AI and robotics for physics experiments look like?
