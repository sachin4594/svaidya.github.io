title: "Observation of a Charge-2 Photonic Weyl Point in the Infrared"
collection: publications
permalink:
excerpt: 'Weyl points are robust point degeneracies in the band structure of a periodic material, which act as monopoles of Berry curvature. They have been at the forefront of research in three-dimensional topological materials as they are associated with novel behavior both in the bulk and on the surface. Here, we present the experimental observation of a charge-2 photonic Weyl point in a low-index-contrast photonic crystal fabricated by two-photon polymerization. The reflection spectrum obtained via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy closely matches simulations and shows two bands with quadratic dispersion around a point degeneracy.'
